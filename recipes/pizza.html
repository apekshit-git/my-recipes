      <li>Make the pizza dough</li>
      <li>
        First, put the flour, sugar, salt and yeast in a large bowl making sure
        to put the salt and yeast at opposite sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the water and olive oil and start to mix it together with a spoon or
        spatula to form a rough dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shape the dough into a ball and knead on a lightly floured surface for
        around 10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shape the dough into a nice round ball and place in a lightly oiled
        clean bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and sit the dough in a dry warm
        place for 2-3 hours or until doubled in size.

      <li>
        Lightly dust two large baking trays with semolina flour, roll out the

        mixture all over the base of each pizza.
